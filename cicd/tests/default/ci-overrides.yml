# Ansible variable overrides for CI
# Currently only used to override NetQ config in the inventories/evpn_xxxx/group_vars/all/services.yml file
# This gets passed in as --extra-vars on the ansible-playbook cli
# Ideally we don't want overrides: they represent differences between staging(simulation) and prod. That's generally not a good thing.
